<h2>Notes on the Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE</h2>

<ul>

<li>The original jEdit look-and-feel is generally preserved, although
  some default properties have been changed to accommodate Isabelle
  (e.g. main the text area font).</li>

<li>Formal Isabelle/Isar text is checked asynchronously while editing.
  The user is in full command of the editor, and the prover refrains
  from locking portions of the buffer etc.</li>

<li>Prover feedback works via tooltips, syntax highlighting, colors,
  boxes etc. based on semantic markup provided by Isabelle in the
  background.</li>

<li>Using the mouse together with the modifier key <tt>C</tt>
(<tt>CONTROL</tt> on Linux or Windows,
  <tt>COMMAND</tt> on Mac OS) exposes additional information.</li>

<li>Dockable panels (e.g. <em>Output</em>) are managed as independent
  windows by jEdit, which also allows multiple instances.</li>

</ul>
